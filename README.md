# Secure-Password-Generator

A Python-based "Secure Password Generator" that allows users to create strong and customizable passwords based on their preferences. The tool ensures that the generated passwords meet high-security standards and includes a minimum password length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters), and randomization.

# Features
1. Customizable Password: Users can choose the password length and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. Security-First Approach:- Enforces a minimum length of 8 characters.
                          - Guarantees the inclusion of at least one character from each selected category (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
                          - Randomizes the order of characters for added security.
3. Interactive CLI: Simple and user-friendly command-line interface to guide users through the password creation process.

# How It Works
1. The script asks users for their preferences:
   - Length of the password.
   - Whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. It then generates a password that meets the specified criteria and ensures that at least one character from each selected category is included.
3. The password is shuffled to ensure randomization.
